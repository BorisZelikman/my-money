# Roadmap Compliance Rules

- You should always strive to follow the plan from [roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md).
- Before starting to think about your answer, understand which step you need to complete next.
- If the user's request contradicts the plan, fulfill the request anyway.
- If the user's request is not related to the current project, fulfill the request.
- At the end of each task edit [roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md) to check off the completed steps.
- If the user disrupts the order of steps, still edit [roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md) to check off the completed steps.
- At the end of each response, write to the user which steps have been completed, in the format "[X] Step name". Use wording from [roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md).
- Implement only those items in the [roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md) that you are explicitly asked to do.
- If you edited [roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md), write in the chat "🔄Roadmap has been updated"
