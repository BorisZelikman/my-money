# Migration Roadmap: My Money App to Vite + TypeScript + CI/CD

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the migration from Create React App (CRA) to a modern Vite + TypeScript stack with CI/CD pipeline, ensuring data portability and modern best practices.

The roadmap is divided into **short MVPs** (Minimum Viable Products) to allow early testing and validation at each stage.

**Branch**: `feature/vite-typescript-migration`

## Data Portability Notes

Since the app uses **Firebase** for backend:
- ✅ User data is stored in Firebase Firestore (cloud)
- ✅ Authentication via Firebase Auth works across domains
- ✅ Same Firebase project can be used with new domain
- ✅ No data migration needed - just configure new app to use same Firebase project
- ⚠️ Update Firebase authorized domains in Firebase Console
- ⚠️ Update CORS settings if using Firebase Storage

**Users will automatically have access to their data** on the new domain once they log in with the same credentials.

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:
1. Keep old CRA version deployed and accessible (`origin/mutuals` branch)
2. Point DNS back to old deployment
3. Communicate with users about rollback
4. Fix issues in new version
5. Re-deploy when ready

---

## Notes
- Each MVP is independently testable
- Don't proceed to next MVP until current MVP tests pass
- CI/CD moved early to enable remote testing from MVP 2
- Adjust timeline based on actual progress
- Consider feature freeze on old app during migration
- Regular code reviews recommended at each MVP completion
